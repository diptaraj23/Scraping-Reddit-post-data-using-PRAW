This is my first post on Reddit and I pray to not be the last one. Just now I have read news about the potential invasion to the territory of Ukraine today in the night.  I\`m (f 25)  panicking here. People... I just want to live in peace in Ukraine. I\`m proud of being Ukrainian. Here is my motherland and doesnt matter which places I visit around the world I love Ukraine with all my heart and soul. I love Ukrainian people.I want to live in Ukraine, I want to give birth to children in Ukraine. I want to speak Ukrainian language. I have no hate to Russian people and Russian language or any other natonalities or other languages. I watch how Russia bites huge pieces from my country and destroy all Ukrainian what exist there. I\`m so much afraid this will happen with all Ukraine. I\`m afraid to lose my nationality. Believe me or not, the worst what can happen to Ukraine is to be Russian.Why tf they destroy lives of usual Ukrainain people? Russian president pretends to be a God so he can decide the destiny of the whole nation.

I\`m so much f\*cking afraid right now.

What to do, people? I\`m crying at loud here because I actually have no choice. I don\`t know what to do. I\`m desperate. I don\`t want to run away from Ukraine and watch how Ukraine suffers. I don\`t want war but it seems Russia has already decided.I just want to survive this war.I want my family will survive. We will fight till we die here for our nation.

But... but if Ukraine lose this war. This is not guilt of Ukrainian people. This is the collapse of worlds democracy.

People, never ever trust to Russian government. Never ever trust to Russian news. Live in peace, never make war.

P.S. If Russian government would occupy Ukraine and would ever say that we wanted to be Russians, you should know that nobody asked and we have never wanted.

P.P.S. Apology for all the mistakes.

Edit: I really try my best to answer to everybody, thank you for all of your support, people... Personally me greatly thankful and every your message is greatly appreciated by me... and be sure every Ukrainian who reads it",0.82

If you pay me for 40 hours you get 40 hours,MaliciousCompliance,11806,sy11x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/sy11x1/if_you_pay_me_for_40_hours_you_get_40_hours/,418,1645469227.0,"Not sure if it belongs here but here goes:

I work a consulting engineer designing and implementing systems (network and server) upgrades for organizations with worldwide locations. When initially hired by my company the agreement was I would get paid for every hour I worked, usually 40 hours a week when at the home site, up to 80+ hours per week when at the customer's location.  No overtime, just straight time as my position is ""exempt"".  While on-site I would also be paid MI&E (Lodging expenses, Mileage expenses, and Meal & Incidental Expenses) to include rental car. MI&E can add up to a couple thousand a week in places like Hawaii, Japan or England.

Flash forward a few years and the company has been bought and merged a couple of times and the new company decides that exempt employees are now salary and will not pay for any hours over 40 plus of course no discussion of negotiating a new rate due to the change in working conditions. This reduces my annual compensation by over 20K per year as I would be at a customer's site for 4-6 months a year.  I walk into the bosses office to discuss, he says nothing to discuss.

Next time I am planning for a site, the plan is for me and my team to work 40 hours a week meaning an additional 3 weeks on site, neither the customer nor my boss were happy.  The additional three weeks added over 50K in MI&E to the estimate because it isn't just me that does the work and the total number of chargeable hours is the same if we are on site 4 weeks or 7 weeks.

Sorry, if you only pay me for 40 hours I only work 40 hours.  A couple of VPs were quickly brought into the conversation and the new policy was quickly modified, when at a customer site we now get paid for every hour we work.",0.97

As part of a work perk, I get to stay in some nice hotels with pools once in a while, so I would always bring my glorious turquoise bikini to enjoy the amenities. 

On my last trip before the pandemic in 2019, I left my bikini at the hotel as I am often very forgetful (apologies to all hotel staff having to clean up after idiots like me). Luckily a work friend was passing by the same city the following week. He picked up my bikini from the hotel and planned to bring it the office (thanks to local colleagues helping coordinate this pick-up).

Because we travel so often for work, he and I never ended up overlapping at the office until the pandemic hit. I assumed he lost my bikini in transit (RIP bikini) as he insisted he returned it to me. 

Flash forward, it is 2022, I get a panicked call from my friend. Apparently as he and his wife moved houses, she found my my turquoise bikini. She immediately assumed the worst and went to stay with her in-laws. My friend took a good week to recall how the bikini ended up in his possession, and a few awkward phone calls with several colleagues later, he realised it was my bikini. A few apologies and explanations later, his wife returned home. Phew. 

TL/DR: TIFU when I almost caused my good friends grief and potentially a divorce by leaving my bikini at a hotel after a work trip.",0.96

*This is a repost.* [*The original post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/) *is by* [u/DangerousGrocery](https://www.reddit.com/user/DangerousGrocery/) *posted January 23rd, 2018*

My boyfriend and I are both young professionals in our late twenties who moved in together six months ago after graduating from professional school and relocating to a new city for work. We have been together for four years and have had no issues adjusting to living together. We are happy together, want the same things out of life, and take excellent care of each other.

The issue is that I have known for a while that he is the person that I want to spend my life with, and I would like to settle down and hopefully start a family soon. I have been in a serious relationship (also lasted 4 years) before him, so I know what I am looking for. On the other hand, my boyfriend is not in the same headspace as me about this for a few reasons: 1) He was a late bloomer when it comes to relationships, and I was his first real girlfriend, and 2) he has a hard time making decisions about everything, from his job to what pair of shoes to buy. When we discuss the future, I am very clear that I‚Äôm ready to settle down with him ASAP. He is also very clear that he loves me, he thinks we have a great thing, but he wants to take more time to ‚Äúsee where it goes.‚Äù He also jokes around about how he hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbanged enough chicks.‚Äù We had some serious commitment discussions last year when we were deciding where to live after graduating, and I told him that I wasn‚Äôt going to try to relocate to the same city as him unless we were engaged. He didn‚Äôt propose, and I stuck to my guns. Despite very slim odds, we both coincidentally found jobs in the same city halfway across the country, so we moved there together and got an apartment together.

Now I‚Äôm starting to get fed up and hurt about this situation. It was causing a lot of stress for me, and it was the main point of contention in our relationship. So in September 2017, I told him that when our lease is up in April 2018 I was going to move out unless we were engaged. He hasn‚Äôt made a decision ever in his life without a deadline, so I figured this would help nudge him in the right direction. However, I‚Äôm starting to worry that he‚Äôs not going to propose (mostly because he's telling me that he's not going to propose). Now I‚Äôm regretting this ultimatum, and I think maybe I was stupid for ruining a good thing by trying to rush things (but it‚Äôs been FOUR YEARS). Also I worry that if he does propose, it will be forced and he‚Äôll always regret it.

On the other hand, I gave him basically the same ultimatum last year during our job search, and he made it very clear that he'd rather end up in different cities (which knowing us would likely mean breaking up) than get engaged. I‚Äôd like to think that I am being rational and empowered here, but am I being stupid and desperate? If he doesn‚Äôt propose by April, should I stick to my guns and move out, basically sacrificing this great relationship because it wasn‚Äôt moving at my pace?

I'm happy to answer any questions too! This situation is getting so stressful, and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and give advice.

[***UPDATE***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/) ***posted March 21st, 2018***

Boyfriend knew and acknowledged the ultimatum, and I tried to use this as a springboard to have a serious conversation about where he sees the future going. We did have some sit-down talks that didn't really go anywhere, and he told me to stop bringing it up, so I stopped. We carried on for a little while being our happy selves, without mentioning the ultimatum. Part of me hoped he had a proposal planned and would surprise me. Nope. Now, we are 10 days away from the 3/31 deadline (which I 100% plan to stick to), and he just told me that he wants me to visit his parents in their home in September, and after the visit he would then talk with them about our relationship and consider proposing around December.

Part of me is so insulted and angry by this idea. First of all, I have met his parents before and actually spent plenty of quality time with them (so far I like them, they like me). They live in a more isolated state that's hard to get to from where I live (plane tickets are pretty expensive, would be a 2 day drive). I have suggested that I visit them multiple times, and we've had plenty of opportunities to do so, but my boyfriend was against it for one reason or another.

The saddest thing is that we both coordinated time off work last week. We knew about the vacation for months and had plenty of time to plan. He told me that he was going to visit his parents, and said that he was thinking about asking me to come with, but kept it vague. I looked up fights (which were reasonable in price at the time) and tried to plan everything, but when I presented the information to BF he would say ""not now"" ""too busy"" and put off planning the trip. Then, less than three weeks before the vacation started, BF told me I needed to come to his family's home with him on this trip, and if that didn't happen, there was no way he would propose. By that time, all the flights I had been tracking had gone way up in price because the departure date was so close. It would have been financially very tight for me to pay for that flight, and honestly I think what he did was crappy, because he told me at the last minute what I HAD to do instead of planning in advance like I had tried to do. So I thought it over and decided not to go with him.

Now he is saying the reason he can't propose is because I haven't met his family in their home. Like I said, met his family a handful of time in the past, his family and my family have met each other, etc. He says that this needs to happen for his family to be okay with us getting married. If he had told me anytime before the vacation was close and flight prices shot up, it would be fine. We had multiple vacations since I issued the ultimatum and we could have gone to visit his parents then. I feel like this whole thing was him setting me up for failure so that he could not propose and then blame it on me. Not sure if it's relevant, but he is Asian-American and I am white, he was born in the US. I asked him if the need for me to visit his parent's home before he proposes is an aspect of his culture, and he said ""maybe."" I don't want to be culturally insensitive at all, so if anyone has knowledge about this, please share.

Now that we're 10 days out and he's realizing I'm serious, he spends all our time together begging me not to go through with it. But he's not planning to propose. He says it doesn't make sense because he's telling me that he would propose in December, but he was willing to take the risk of losing me rather than propose by April. I see where he's coming from in a way, if we do both want to get married, but I can't do this anymore. Also I think he's an adult and find it insulting that he is blaming this whole thing on his parents not meeting me in their home. They are asking him constantly what his plan is with me (they don't know about the ultimatum), and so I get the impression that they are just as curious about the future of our relationship as I am. I don't think they sat him down and told him I need to visit them before he can propose, but that's just a hunch.

Any advice or comments on this situation would be appreciated.

[***SECOND UPDATE***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aijhzx/update_1_year_later_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m/) ***posted January 21st, 2019***

***March 2018***: I couldn't go through with the ultimatum. I was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. But when push came to shove, I couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. I decided that I loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that I had created. I also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in December. I felt I was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because I wouldn't wait another few months. As a compromise, he said we could get a cat (I had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. On 3/31, the day I was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

***April-September 2018***: My boyfriend and I spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. We both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. I got a therapist and started working on myself. I picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. I think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. Also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. I'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. By the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. He also complaints about our cat constantly.

***September 2018- visiting his family***: As I promised him, I went to visit his parents in their home in September. As I mentioned in the previous post, he is Chinese-American (and I'm white), so I studied up on my basic Chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. It was a great trip, and I genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. I left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). I asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in December would be ""too fast."" That seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. He also told me I needed to learn Chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect English but prefer Chinese when they are with family), so I started doing Rosetta Stone.

***October-December 2018***: Around November, I started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. He was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. For instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by December because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). Another time, he freaked out that I have student loans (most people in my profession do, and I have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. Luckily I already have this spreadsheet, which I showed him, and he calmed down.

In the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. Although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because I was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. I worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. I also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- I stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as I had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). We spent Christmas together for the first time this year, and I really thought he would propose then. But he didn't, and I didn't bring it up or pout about it. He visited his family for New Years and I was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

***January 2019:*** I accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. I was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and I tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. I was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. It's now to the point that I equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that I shouldn't have. I realize I've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. But a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. First, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if I stay onboard long term. However, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (I am actually okay with it for the most part). He also has given a hard NO to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). I started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

Then, this weekend I went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. Also, I want to have kids, that's the main reason I am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). So yesterday, I was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and I had this ""Aha!"" moment where I realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. There's no shame in having my own wants. And at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (No marriage, we can't stay in the city where I have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but I've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with HIS desires. So I'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

I'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. Also I am willing to hear all the ""I told you so'"" from everyone who said I needed to leave this guy in March when I said I would. I totally deserve it. Thanks for reading!

Why is it not just as acceptable to him to not want marriage as it is for her to want it? Sure break up with him, but if he didn't want to be married, her trying to pressure him into it with an ultimatum is ridiculous.

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aijhzx/comment/eeow9ju/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**-**

Since the very beginning he says he wants marriage and 2-3 kids. In the past 1-2 years, sometimes he says he wants those things with me. But a lot of times recently he's been saying ""I can't marry you!"" when I do little things he doesn't like (e.g. when I farted near him). Sometimes I confront him when he says it and he claims he's joking.

But yeah, we actually do want the same things, or so he claims. But he has a mental block toward taking actions toward making it a reality. Plus, the changing timelines and all the hoops he asks me to jump through are showing me that he's stalling for some reason.

I've asked why he's stalling, but all he can give me are the excuses of family, money, he wants to see my student loans, etc. I wonder if these are the real issues, or whether he has some other reason that he doesn't want to tell me.

I just think that OP has a whole lot more flaws than just listening. I'm pretty sure that's she's got a whole lot of her own issues that she's not telling us & I don't expect her to. All I'm saying is without knowing both sides of the story I'm just not willing to call her BF a scumbag.

Of course I have flaws :-). Many of them have been pointed out by commenters here. Of course my BF isn't an asshole. No one is all good or all bad. I think the whole realization I'm coming to here is that I have grown beyond this relationship.

People who are afraid of commitment are just as afraid of breaking up as they are getting married. They are afraid of committing to either of those big decisions! So instead, they stay stagnant. No growth, just making their partner feel like they are not good enough when the opposite is actually true.

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aijhzx/comment/ees4oy9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**-**

OMG yes that is true of my BF. I am planning to speak with him tonight about all of this, and I know he'll be just as upset with the prospect of ending the relationship as he was about getting married.

&#x200B;

***FINAL UPDATE (added in the post)***

Wow, thank you Reddit for the super thoughtful replies! I read each one (so far)!

I spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. I started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. He brought up the fact that it‚Äôs moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. That we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that I want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes I make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. He worries about the fact that I get a lot of Amazon packages and he doesn't know what I am buying (showed him my Amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). Also this is all on my credit card (which I comfortably pay off each month) so I don't think I need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. He also doesn't like that I'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). Also, since it came up a lot in the comments, I wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we‚Äôre an interracial couple.

However, after all this, he said he‚Äôs not ready for marriage. I was pretty pissed and told him I wished he told me this a year ago so I could have moved on. He basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. So I told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. He's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but I'm remaining gently firm here.",0.91

No more having to gently ask him to clean this or that while I'm at work (and he still gets pissy about it).

No holiday or birthday gifts, no random small gestures of love and appreciation ""just because"". No romantic dates, nothing. 

I'm done putting up with the ""teasing"".

Gherks Reason For Not DRSing is Total BS,Superstonk,2783,sybcrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sybcrf/gherks_reason_for_not_drsing_is_total_bs/,1099,1645495531.0,"So I'm sure you have all seen Gherks recent autobiography that includes his reasoning for not DRSing his shares. He basically states that DRSing does not affect the shorts ability to create and use synthetic shares to short the stock, because locates simply aren't happening. This is correct, but it completely misses the actual point of why we are trying to register the float.

GameStops publicly available float is between 30M and 60M shares depending on what all you're including. GameStop just announced the number of shares that were held in DRS in their last quarterly report (btw the fact they did this should already convince you of the importance of DRSing your shares, this shit is unprecedented). Assuming they continue to announce the total shares held at ComputerShare each quarter, we *will* eventually know as an indesputable fact when we have registered the entire float.

The point of this is not to take liquidity and shares available to short away from the SHFs. In fact I'm convinced that theory is complete FUD. The real point of this is *publicly announcing that the entire float is owned by retail, while large volumes of trades continue to hit the exchange, which should be impossible.*

When that happens, it's absolutely game over for hedgies. The corruption in the market will be undeniably exposed and the public, and I mean the entire public, will then be aware that we were right. Massive FOMO, protest, and hopefully regulatory action *will* follow.

Options plays creating gamma pressure certainly helps create squeeze situations, I'm not denying that. But it's not only foolish to say that options are the only way to force MOASS, it's actually completely wrong. I am completely convinced that once the entire float is registered and it is announced publicly, MOASS will begin.

It would be a analogous to when Porsche announced that they owned 74.1% of VW which notified the public that there was a very small number of shares available (6%) to be bought up by hedge funds to cover the 13% short interest that existed. The difference is that GME is probably shorted an order of magnitude higher than 13% and at that point there would be exactly 0% of the float available to purchase to cover those positions. Infinity pool anyone?

I'm sorry but stop fanboying for people that have a platform to uphold. Gherk built his platform on options plays and now he refuses to change his mindset because that is what brought him his following. I don't have any hate for Gherk but I really dislike the fact that he has such a large presence here and sows doubt on our one true ticket to salvation. DIRECT REGISTERING THE ENTIRE FLOAT.

DRS is the way. Peace out y'all.",0.75

Conservatism won't cure homelessness,Seattle,5540,sy12g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/sy12g7/conservatism_wont_cure_homelessness/,1087,1645469267.0,"I've lived in Seattle for nearly 20 years now - now raising a family here. Over this time I've seen homelessness more than double, and the city gradually morph into a playground for the rich. The average house costs a million dollars, while thousands of people sleep under tarps in the cold and the rain. 8% of schoolkids in our state are homeless, while billionaires don't even have to pay a cent of income tax. The population of the city is growing by leaps and bounds, while 75% of Seattle doesn't allow apartments by zoning law.

This is a problem caused by extreme inequality, terrible housing policy, the utter demolition of a social safety net, and regressive taxation; in short, the fact that our state and city, despite the ""liberal"" veneer, are much more keen to placate wealthy people and landowners than the average lower-middle-class family struggling not to get evicted. We have at every turn watered down progressive proposals for housing, for taxation, for sustainability. Meanwhile, conservatives use the burgeoning homelessness and squalor - which are caused by conservatism - as a cudgel to, paradoxically, beat *progressives* with.

This sub is part of this trend:

* Deny that housing unaffordability has anything to do with homelessness. (It's always something else: drug addiction, mental illness, poor life choices - anything that we can blame on the victim rather than the system.)

* Constantly insist that if you could only sweep away all the tarps, the problem would go away. 

* Always object to housing-first, insisting that people must jump through hoops to deserve housing, despite the evidence showing that putting hurdles in the way of housing is a bad idea.

* Demand that evictions resume ASAP.

* Push the War On Drugs.

* In short, perpetuate the idea that we can hate our way out of homelessness.

We can't. You can't cure homelessness by hating homeless people any more than you can cure cancer by hating cancer patients.

A handful of people in this sub, as well as bad actors with very new accounts, are constantly posting homeless sensationalism or inundating the comment threads with homeless-hatred sentiment. They will no doubt be commenting on this thread as well. 

The propaganda on this sub needs to end. There are policy measures and evidence-based solutions to homelessness. We need to look to them, not to hatred, to solve this crushing problem.",0.83

We all know that after drinking, after sex, or just randomly your piss stream wants to shoot in  7 different directions with none of them being into the toilet. This is a universal upgrade for pissing. The number one counter-argument i hear is that ‚Äúoh but my neighbors will see me pissing‚Äù. If we just all agree to have a pact that pissing outside is fine, just try to aim so that the neighbors cant see your goodies, everyone will be de-sensitized to it and move on.

A nurse calls me a slow learner after a cancer-related surgery. I lose my shit on her.,pettyrevenge,4912,sxympe,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/sxympe/a_nurse_calls_me_a_slow_learner_after_a/,255,1645463323.0,"Let me preface this by saying this happened about 7 years ago when I was 19 being diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I am perfectly fine now and I really don't want pity points. My cancer has been long since put into remission and I have enjoyed many years of good health. It's unlikely to come back ever or at least anytime soon. I am only talking about this to give some added context, so when I mention how I was feeling at the time know that I have long since been very healthy and actually had it pretty easy when it comes to cancer.

So like I said, I was 19 and had something very wrong with the side of my neck. My lymph nodes on the right side had been severely inflamed for months, and after an ultrasound, we pretty much knew it was definitely some type of cancer. The real anxiety behind all this was *what kind.* Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are two very different beasts and I was really hoping to have the former.

I go in for a procedure called an incisional biopsy, which is exactly what it sounds like. They make me go to sleep, they make an incision, and take out a sample of the affected tissue for testing to make a diagnosis. I was really trying to put on a hard face for all this. Friends, family, and my doctor had all remarked on how well I was taking the whole thing, but really I was scared shitless. I was thinking about dying to cancer a lot. So needless to say when it was the day of my surgery, I was very anxious and generally feeling very sad. I tried to hide it, but that's the truth.

So the procedure goes on. They put me to sleep, they get the needed sample, and next thing I know I am waking up in the post anesthesia care unit. As I wake up, a female nurse probably in her mid-40s is checking my pulse-ox. 'Oh you're awake, how are you feeling?'

I was feeling like complete shit emotionally but physically I felt fine besides feeling insanely groggy. It was my first time being put to sleep for a procedure and I was feeling pretty 'drunk' and very mentally raw. My lips are cracked in a million different places because I had to fast for this surgery and my mouth feels like its full of sand. She asks me a few questions like where I am, what I was here for, etc just to gauge if I was waking up okay. She then asks me if I want a cup of water or ginger ale. I would have killed for a drink lol.

""Yes please. A ginger ale would be amazing.""

She says sure thing and then asks how old I am. I tell her 19 and she says ""Oh, my daughter is 19 too!""

She goes onto to talk about her daughter for what had to have been at least 10 minutes. I get that I was very groggy but it had to have been at least close to that long. She explains her daughter is studying premed at our city's public university. It is not an ivy league school, but it is very respected, especially for medical study. I am already feeling like shit hearing this because I know I am going to be out of college for who knows how long and I used to be very eager with some pretty big aspirations. I am wincing through this because my education being put on pause and my own personal shortcomings are not something I wanted to be faced with quite this second, but nevertheless she continues.

Finally she asks me about what I want to do. I told her and she seems pretty unimpressed and gives some unsolicited advice on career choices. I try to make myself seem as disinterested as possible, but I listen to her talk her bullshit for another few minutes.

Then she asks me where I go to school.

'I am just attending community college at the moment.'

'Oh, I'm sorry. Are you a slow learner, honey?'

I was seeing red. I really don't EVER lose my shit on strangers. ESPECIALLY people who are helping me or providing me a service. But between my insane level of anxiety regarding my upcoming diagnosis, the anesthesia having an effect on me, having fasted, and this blathering idiot of a woman blatantly talking down to me, I had enough.

I stayed silent for a few seconds and I remember sitting up a bit more in the stretcher. ""No, I am not. Are *you* a slow learner?"" I asked.

She looked a bit taken back for a second and said 'No?'

'Then why the *fuck* haven't you gotten me my ginger ale yet?'

She just hung her mouth open SO wide and walked away. Needless to say that after I got my ginger ale (a little too much ice but I let it slide) I didn't hear a fucking WORD from her again. Even when medical transport came to get me, she didn't say good-bye hahaha. I was honestly very surprised at myself (and a bit ashamed for a while) at what I had said, but I had so many other things on my mind I never really thought much about it until I was healthy again.

Did I ever finish college? No. But it was never because I was a 'slow learner'. I did make it to a very respected university myself, but I didn't finish. I have had years to think back on this very hard time in my life and the many mistakes I made proceeding it. Life threw me even more curve-balls after I was better, and it is only now at nearly 27 years old that I feel like I am in a good place mentally again, where I can think about finishing college. I'll probably test the waters with another semester in community college again.

Whenever I think on this sort of thing, I am reminded of how out of touch this woman was with the world when she likely has to deal with life or death everyday. I actually was working as a patient tech in the same hospital I had this surgery done up until a few months ago, and I ashamed to say that while there is a lot of great nurses out there, there is just as many ignorant and spiteful ones who are clearly there just for a check.

That being said, I hope I never get to a point in my life where I am so apathetic and oblivious to the feelings of others where I would say some shit like that.",0.95

My wife (30F) has recently achieved a lot success in her career. Kudos to her, I‚Äôve been extremely supportive of her goal and in all honesty, she‚Äôs killing it. Her job is demanding, yet she still finds time to workout, take care of items at home, etc. Literally zero complaints on my end. She seems possessed she‚Äôs so motivated in all facets of life right now. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of her.

Now for myself (30M), I‚Äôve also had a lot of success in my career as of recent. I was recently promoted to a position I only dreamed of, and am in the middle of a project that is taking a HUGE amount of time and effort. This job is an enormous step up, and honestly, my wife could call it deuces with working altogether if she chose to do so (I‚Äôd like to emphasize I‚Äôd never tell her or even suggest she stop working as her work seems to fulfill her). This project will continue to take a lot of time and effort for a handful of months before I can ‚Äútake a break.‚Äù To be exact, 3 months before I get back to a normal routine. I communicated that with my wife prior to and during the commencement of the project and all seemed hunky dory. 

This is where it gets weird: My wife sat me down a few weeks ago and asked if I was intimidated by her success. I was a bit thrown off by the question, so I chuckled and obviously told her no. And I meant that. She then told me that she needs someone who is as motivated as she is and I‚Äôm dropping the ball. 

I genuinely did not understand, so I asked for clarification. She wants me to contribute more around the house, focus on my physical health, etc. Guys, when I tell you I‚Äôm in great shape both mentally and physically, I‚Äôm not kidding. We live in a beautiful and well kept home. Hell, in my eyes, we‚Äôre living the dream. I‚Äôll admit I hit the gym much less, but this is more so from lack of time than lack of motivation. Now for household chores‚Ä¶ the house is clean. Dishes are always done. Laundry is always done. House is always well kept and maintained. I would NEVER say this, but if we‚Äôre playing the ‚Äúwho‚Äôs dropping the ball‚Äù game, I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs a stickler for keeping up with the laundry and keeping the house in order.

A few weeks have passed, and I‚Äôve been very intentional with my time. I‚Äôm up early to crank out work before she‚Äôs home. I‚Äôll be sitting at the door when she shows up with dinner ready. I thought maybe she felt as if I wasn‚Äôt giving her enough of my time. No luck, she‚Äôs still unhappy. I literally don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs like my very presence just pisses her off, and it kind of sucks, because I‚Äôm genuinely putting in 100% effort.

So please help. Can someone please help me break this down, because there is very clearly something I‚Äôm missing. Like whatever the problem is is right in front of my face, and I‚Äôm just too much of a dummy to grasp it. She‚Äôs truly been a great wife/person, so this little hiccup is kind of out of left field. I‚Äôm just confused.

TLDR: My wife wants more from me. She wants me to help more around the house or contribute more to our marriage. I‚Äôm doing all of that, and the problem persists.",0.98

I'll try to keep this as short as  possible. Sorry for mobile formatting. I've never really seen eye-to-eye  with my MIL because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like  this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them  for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... I understand that  children need discipline, but I prefer a gentler approach with my son.  I've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists I let  it go, so I've tried to.

Until  now. My son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut  allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. She insists that when she was  younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get  rid of them via exposure and that I'm just babying him. I've explained  to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

She  has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up,  she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my  driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing  has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. I told him she  could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my  husband, she cried to him saying I accused her of being an unfit  grandmother. Which I admittedly did because my child's safety is my  priority and apparently not hers.

Now  my husband wants me to apologise to her. He says she would take him to  the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that I'm overreacting. I kindly  explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your  airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and  time is OF THE ESSENCE because it happens so quickly.

So, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

She's  even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a  LOT of peanuts, everywhere. I asked that she find a peanut free zone  which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and  insisted he would be fine.

I'm  getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has  always been a Mama's boy who thinks Mama can do no wrong and defends her  endlessly. He says he turned out just fine being raised by her and I  worry too much.

Would it be awful  if I insist she only see him if I'm present? Am I completely  unreasonable and overreacting? Is there anything else I can do so that  they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more  precautions?

**EDIT/MINI-UPDATE**:  First of all, woah. I did not expect this to get so much attention.  Thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to  reply. In case you missed it: I'VE LEFT FOR NOW, removed my son from the  situation, and I'm now currently staying at my brother's house. At  least for a few days until things cool off and I'm able to have a sit  down discussion with my husband and his mother. In the mean time, I've  sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences  where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one).  Unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the  subject. My husband has been to the same appointments I have with my  son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to  appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

Some  people have accused me of being a helicopter Mom, or trying to demonize  my MIL. And given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe I'm overreacting  or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then I'm okay.  I'm not even a SAHM, we have an incredible nanny while I work FT, who  respects my kid's allergies and adores him. In the past, I've tried my  best for my MIL to get quality time with her grandson, although we may  not see eye-to-eye, I've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. But I'm  not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

Lastly,  I just want to say my MIL has diabetes and is against modern medicine  and sees a naturopath. She won't take metformin or insulin and thinks  everything can be treated herbally. So, I don't think having a sit down  with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her  is going to help much. She's very strong in her beliefs. I did text her  asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet  to reply. My husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read  f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so I told him to find  time or he won't be getting ANY time with my son until he does. If he's  going to be so careless, I'll end up dealing with this legally.

Thanks again everyone. Words can't express my gratitude. I will update with a new thread eventually.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f6emr9/update_my_f28_mil_wont_take_my_kids_4/) via [Reveddit](https://www.reveddit.com/v/relationship_advice/comments/f6emr9/update_my_f28_mil_wont_take_my_kids_4/?ps_after=1582141515) Feb 2020

&#x200B;

Hey folks, it's been half a year since my last post, a lot of people asked for an update. So, as promised, here we go:

A couple of weeks after the initial incident, my husband asked me to  reconcile. I agreed on the basis that he see an allergist and  pediatrician with me, and actually really, really listen to and learn  fully about the severity of the anaphylactic allergy. He agreed. We did  just that. He had been to the same appointments as me prior, but I felt  he never really listened, this time we did. We also went through a lot  of the resources you guys shared on my last post, together. He got way  better with things for a while, he took it more seriously, and we  gradually started incorporating gradual supervised MIL visits again  (because, unsurprisingly, she was begging to see our son).

Her behavior didn't improve, she refused to hear out any professional  opinions due to her naturopathic beliefs. Because of this, I did not  let her spend time with him unless I was there for myself, strongly  believing that she could still persuade my husband to her ""side of  things"".

This worked ok for a while. She would occasionally say snarky things toward me, but nothing crazy. 

Until one time we were in the kitchen, I gave my son some homemade  cookies in a bowl; cookies I made with certified peanut-free ingredients  as per the packaging. MIL visited while my husband was at work, she  walked in and saw my son eating cookies and inquired about them. I  explained I made them. She went to grab the bowl of cookies (just 2, but  gave him a bowl to help with crumbs, lol) from him. He tightened his  grip, so she slapped his hand, grabbed the bowl, and threw it against  the wall. She was yelling about how she doesn't get to make him any  desserts anymore, I calmly explained she knows why this is. She said  packaging can say it's from a peanut-free facility but be wrong and  still have cross-contamination, that I was an idiot, and that I didn't  care about my son. 

My son was crying his eyes out at this point. So, I asked her to  leave, and told her she could come back later and we could discuss it  with my husband present.

We did just that. We sat down to discuss things, and after a few  minutes, she said I was ""lucky they (my husband and her) hadn't started  exposure therapy to my son."" My husband's face went flushed, he fell  completely silent. I asked for clarification, I had to be mishearing  things, there was no way. She explained that my husband and her agreed  they would gradually start introducing peanut products to my son to  build up his ""immunity"" against the allergy. Mind you, they planned on  doing in my kitchen with his epi-pen available, but not medically  supervised or in a safe environment. 

I know on my last post a lot of people mentioned this works for a lot  of allergies, and they're implementing this for nut allergies as well,  BUT BY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL/ALLERGIST USING ORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY OR A  PEANUT PATCH. To my knowledge, most of its use has been in clinic trials  at this point. 

Also, alarmingly:  ""Data from more than 1,000 children who had taken part in ""oral  immunotherapy"" trials found 22.2 per cent of children who had exposure  therapy experienced anaphylaxis attacks."" So, this certainly isn't something that should just be done in your home  kitchen by untrained family members.

That aside, no matter how you feel about immunotherapy, naturopathy,  or anything else mentioned; I was extremely angry they planned to do  this behind my back. My husband's only defense, once again, was that he  was just trying to appease his Mother. That, more or less, he will  always side with her and do what we can to make her happy. She's very  unwell, she has diabetes as previously mentioned, and still doesn't use  insulin or even metformin.

In any case, I couldn't live like that anymore, I couldn't trust him  anymore to be there for me and more importantly to protect our son. My  utmost priority is (and always has been) to protect my son. So, I  proceeded to file for divorce. Everything is still in the workings, so I  won't touch on the legal side of stuff much. I am going for sole  custody, with my soon-to-be ex-husband getting supervised visitation.  So, that's that. There likely won't be an update in the future. There  isn't much else to say. I'm just ready to move on with my life and raise  an amazing kiddo into an amazing young gentleman.

But mostly, I wanted to update to say thank-you. I did get a lot of  people condemning me, but the overwhelming majority of you were  supportive. Thank-you for sharing your personal anecdotes, for sharing  excellent reading material on the subject, and giving the best advice  possible. This is a wonderful community, and I hope anyone going through  something similar can find solace in a forum like this.

TIFU by sending screenshots of a text conversation with my lover to my married best friend.,tifu,7591,sxzfsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/sxzfsi/tifu_by_sending_screenshots_of_a_text/,267,1645465308.0,"I (30-something M) was traveling abroad a few months ago. I met up with a woman and things went really well between us. We were chatting a lot on WhatsApp. One conversation was particularly juicy, so I took some screenshots and sent them to my best friend. I didn't know that was a fuckup until yesterday.

My best friend lives in another state, but I just happen to be visiting him and his wife right now. His wife went on his phone to look at some pictures he had recently taken of her, and she saw the screenshots I had sent months ago. She thought that they were of a conversation he was having with a woman, so she had to approach him about it while I'm visiting them.

I guess she spent the whole day in emotional agony, waiting for an opportunity to approach him about it when I wasn't with the two of them, but that only made it worse. You see, my friend had totally forgotten that I sent him those messages (I guess a married guy doesn't care much about my dalliances). So, when she was like, ""What is this?"" he had no idea what she was talking about. He was saying something like, ""My phone must have been hacked!"" because he was totally baffled. Of course, she didn't believe that because it sounds like bullshit.

I guess after a long and painful argument, he finally remembered, and had to show her the text conversation between him and me to prove he wasn't full of shit.

She was embarrassed and made him promise not to tell me. He immediately told me, then made me promise not to tell her he told me, then he immediately told her that he told me. She then immediately told me that he told her that he told me.

Honestly, I don't think she should be embarrassed. She wasn't snooping, and those texts would have been pretty damning.

Anyway, I'm glad I didn't cause their divorce!

TL;DR: Sent my friend screenshots of an erotic conversation with my lover. His wife found them and thought he was having an affair. My friend forgot I sent them, so his excuses sounded fake. Turned into a big deal before he finally remembered.

&#x200B;

Edit - I wanted to keep the content of the screenshotted texts as vague as possible, but apparently I kept it too vague and some of you are upset. I think it's silly that you're upset regardless, but let me be clear:

The messages were not ""sexts"". She referenced the fact that we had sex, which is why I called it ""erotic"". Also, the screenshots did not include her name or photo, and were in no way traceable back to her. 

Her message made it sound like she was catching feelings, which is why I sent it to my friend. I was also catching feelings. I wanted to talk to him about that. ",0.94

Wycking off for OPEX: Confluence of Datasets and what drives GME's Quarterly Runs,Superstonk,8608,sy36q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sy36q8/wycking_off_for_opex_confluence_of_datasets_and/,1401,1645474485.0,"Hello Everybody,

As many of you know we have been doing a lot of research into the FTDs, ETF shares creation, and swaps that support these quarterly moves.

After the failure of price action to be realized through. Most of December and January, I will cover what went wrong and what went right later in this DD. Move forward and apply the failures in expectations to future outlooks.

There is a lot of hype built around this week, with expectations high I wanted to ensure to the best of my ability that not only did market mechanics point to an improvement in price this coming week but that volume, trend, stochastic and price analysis indicated it as well.

In an effort to be as absolutely certain as the data available would allow.

# What is OPEX?

OPEX is a bit of a misnomer, it is technically the Options Expiration (OPEX) of ETF and Index options. These actually occur every month but the quarterly options dates are the ones that effect GameStop primarily as the majority of institutional options interest in ETF and Indices is quarterly.

These occur per the [CBOE Calendar](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/options/Cboe2021OPTIONSCalendar.pdf) on the 3rd Friday of every month.

We however are only concerned with the quarterly expirations, which occur in

Feb/May/Aug/Nov

So why do these events which have very little to do with GME have such a great effect?

Well due to share creation in ETFs and lack of interest in borrowing real shares of GME in order to deflate the overnight borrow rate. The vast majority of shares sold are synthetically created by Authorized participants.

As creation/redemption builds in GME containing ETFs large numbers of puts are sold to mark long (Reg T) the net short allocation due from the AP.

It is then likely swaps are used by the fund themselves to offset the debit from creation.

So if XRT is -250,000 shares of GME and they have forwards or an (agreement to buy those shares at a future time based on the current ""spot"" price (market) ) Then their position is considered neutral.

Let me show you visually.

[Yeah I know It's super fucked up, the SEC has been aware of this since 2011...](https://preview.redd.it/0vpzst3fn5j81.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&s=944bd0070e3d5a91bcb738dae2801e29caa51a29)

*\*  Edit 1:*

*Since a lot of the people in the comments are asking me to clarify why this documentlowers my confidence in DRS.  Also, because I see a lot of misinformation surrounding it and want to be 100% clear to avoid confusion.*

* *The share creation process in ETFs and the ability of Authorized Participants to do this essentially as long as GME is held in ETFs* ***without facilitating a locate of real shares***\*. It is unlikely that anything short of 100% share registration could force a squeeze or stop shorting on GME. As long GME volume remains low it is likely this abusive system will continue to be used. The benefit being that we have large unstable price increases every quarter.\*
* *As long as shares are held in ETFs by institutions even with 100% registration this system could continue.* ***To be transparent on this point most ETFs do not allow this abuse, it really seems that XRT and a few smaller ETFs are the primary source of corruption.***
* *It tells me that multiple institutions including the SEC and DTCC are aware of the problem and likely already aware that the float of GME is fully owned, and have yet to take any action.* ***It presents systemic risk***\*...meaning if the process were to be stopped or accounted for it could very well bring down the structure of the entire market.\*
* *Some people in the comments addressed T+5 (it's actually not 6, but since settlement is delayed till the following morning T+6 is used for ease of understanding). I show clearly above how they sell short puts on the ETF to mark long the FTDs which adds 35 calendars to the settlement time (Reg T) then cash settle the FTDs with the ETF. Effectively never returning the synthetic position at least not in the form of stock. The obligations then go on to cycle through CNS until such a time as they are cleared. ETFs have an effectively unlimited free-float, are highly liquid, and thus it is easy to clear FTDs in them.*
* *GME ownership has no effect on ETF FTDs or ETF settlement, while this process effects the ""fair valuation"" of GME there is no way to effect and obligation due to a different asset. This process is criminal, as it defrauds the investors of the ETF and also the investors of the underlying assets.*
* *Essentially ETFs create unlimited liquidity*
* ***I do however agree with Dr. Trimbath, that DRS empowers the individual shareholder and can protect the stock from the effects of abusive short-selling.*** *Unfortunately this process is abusive selling and not short-selling. The difference being short-selling requires a borrow.*
* *I think that Ryan Cohen is already doing the one foolproof thing to stop abusive short-selling and that is building a company that isn't worth shorting ""brick by brick"" and I'm excited to see what it becomes.*
* *In the meantime this winding and unwinding of these ETF positions will continue every quarter until there is evidence that they are no longer doing it via reported FTDs and ETF fund flow.*

So after all that when those forwards are closed and the put oi drops the forward contract counterparty goes and buys some GameStop.

This occurs within T+2 of these OPEX dates along with any gamma exposure from options exercising.

The more creation used in the previous quarter ---> the more GameStop gets purchased.

***\*remember creation is not a short sale, it is a share sold, it is synthetic. A short sale requires a borrow, no share borrow agreement is used in these transactions.***

# Wycoff Accumulation

Some information on this can be found here [Richard D. Wyckoff](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Wyckoff-Method-Wyckoff-Analytics-English.pdf), this price analysis methodology has held up for almost a century due to the market psychology that supports it. It is an invaluable tool for tracking the intentions of large or ""smart"" money investors.

*\*I should note here It is* ***not*** *traditional Technical Analysis while it fathered many of the trend and volume analysis styles that followed it.*

Currently GameStop is displaying classic signs of accumulation. This is significant both in the near and long term as valuation on GME is reassessed by large market participants.

[It looks we are rising on a textbook Wyckoff spring formation it's indicating a spring into a breakout. usually followed by a markup period moving from phase C to phase D](https://preview.redd.it/8kvvfscj54j81.png?width=2457&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ee8ee95b1365c5659c8baf16f7192ac9c4ac4a)

It should be noted there is a bear case for this as well while less fun to hear it's best to temper expectations. It is possible enough interest has not accumulated on GME during this period and there are more low tests in store. I didn't want to ignore this especially with uncertainty in the global political landscape.

https://preview.redd.it/w7c0k1rp75j81.png?width=2463&format=png&auto=webp&s=e495094fbc3b388b27fe1cdbe1ee73b5f4314aca

**I however do not have high confidence in the bear case here, I will now explain why.**

>**A lot of the same pieces are in place. High FTD exposure from ETFs, what looks like institutional buying, and the incoming OPEX cycle. GME's bull case looks very strong. For the near and long-term, as this looks like move into a period of improvement.**

# MACD

I wanted to look at MACD in another way besides the sweeping up and down volume signals. As liquidity dries up I feel that they are less telling than the signal trend so I shaded this so people could see the double divergence in GME's downtrends. This divergence is then mirrored in the uptrends indicating that two primary mechanisms are used to short and then those two mechanisms are covered.

*\*These being ETF share creation and bona-fide market making.*

[I highlighted the signal trend here in an effort to look beyond the volume indicators and focus on the repeating pattern In the daily MACD. That second low peak has marked the beginning of every one of GameStop's previous runs.](https://preview.redd.it/76fg4w62z4j81.png?width=2225&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb15e7a8940e3079e5ad3c68aba12117ee7d877)

# NVI

Negative volume index, I wanted to give people an idea of just how much shorting we have experienced over the last couple months since Nov 3rd (the last time we were above the mean EMA).

Also take a look at volume trend since last march as a little extra confirmation of of illiquidity . Our deviation is the lowest it has been since last December. They can't keep this shit up forever.  :)

[This is literally the best time to buy GME since December of 2020](https://preview.redd.it/o37i40u425j81.png?width=2459&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7919ce96f1d183d5d45fec7828bbb6ece2bd629)

# Price Predictions

So with this Information and the last update I had from yelyah2 showing a gamma maximum of around 140 and some indication of it increasing due to large volumes of OTM calls. I would say a conservative range for this OPEX movement would be between 150 and 180. I have based this prediction on the following factors.

1. Gamma Maximum tends to follow price upwards as more OTM calls are purchased (FOMO) it can drive up but when call buying dwindles there is no more delta to hedge. The rate of change in the underlying slows and price destabilizes. We have yet to hold above our Gamma MAX on any previous run. (see below)
2. Our previous OPEX runs have been fairly range bound with the exception of last February. While I must admit the exposure they have built in the last two months is far greater than anything since last Feb. The strength of OPEX runs had decreased over the remainder of last year. Due to a decrease in long call sentiment and thus weakened ETF exposure. T**here is mathematical evidence that the primary driver of  GME price action are options both up and down** [Evidence of Concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/snzn04/it_takes_money_to_buy_whisky_distilling_gmes/) and that Delta hedging makes up most if not all of our volume. Till it can be debunked, I am convinced that they do **in fact hedge options**.
3. Our volume trends do not support  a move much greater than 180 the strongest buy pressure on GME historically is at 158.50 and 180.00 going back to January of last year. Any price points above that have been met with decreasing buy volume (due to surpassing gamma max) and the price becoming too high to continue FOMO. Simply put Quarterly OPEX alone is not enough to sustain continued price improvement past a certain range. This is one of the reasons our run in November was so weak, since the floor was so high when the run started it was only supported by the clearing of obligations and delta hedging. As soon as the obligations cleared... rug pull.

[Gamma MAX on previous runs \(figure 1\)](https://preview.redd.it/v1x7cpwj95j81.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ebf5495996917e7f7d2bab2932308c0b82fb1c)

[Historical range of OPEX movement \(figure 2\)](https://preview.redd.it/t0zkqsbma5j81.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=4576a0b3588c016ed5a2f8f88588bffdfd4ab1a8)

[Price improvement confidence scale for Feb. 18 -25 OPEX. While this indicates a fairly low range it is possible for FOMO to come in and drive the price even higher but since that is not something that can be predicted or counted on this scenario has the best probability in my mind.](https://preview.redd.it/rnwkmh7je5j81.png?width=2447&format=png&auto=webp&s=3afc6720c24601f8696b73720011dd70a4ba3e51)

# Past Prediction Failures

While I feel many of my predictions have been spot on and they only will increase in accuracy as I narrow down the mechanics of GME price realization. There have been plenty of things I have gotten wrong or did not realize were a factor and thus had not explored.

First let me toot my horn before I focus on the negative.

Some stuff that I 've gotten right...

1. The August run and it's price range.
2. The November run and it's price range (but the volume and velocity were wrong)
3. The runs this last quarter on Dec 17th - 22nd, Jan. 26th, and Feb. 8th (price expectations were not realized)

All of these, months in advance , the biggest disappointments came in the realization of price action. stonks only go up right?

No, the market is dynamic. Things change everyday and no prediction is immune to shifts in macro-economic trends. This is why I update on the status of my theory every day to preempt these shifts and changes, as necessary, in real-time.

[As for the expected run I wrote about these OPEX cycles in August and November of last year.](https://preview.redd.it/1wop6zgib8j81.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97bb068647336150f4b4bb1f98b660b32b33e17)

**So why did December and January fail to drive expected results? or why do you suck Pickle-man?**

In short **XRT**, and some other ETFs that were placed on the threshold list on the futures expiration date.

This action was **beneficial** to the the people generating GME FTDs and I would suspect it was done intentionally, although there is no proof the motive is obvious.

RegSho Threshold while forcing settlement offsets when that settlement is due. So instead of all the ETF FTDs being due the same day it staggers them. This allows them to clear FTDs through CNS without overloading the ""pipeline""(generating price action). Essentially taking GME exposure and diluting it across multiple assets.

https://preview.redd.it/upitmvpce8j81.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=3de4acaf63ac0f0b7a3f999870b0baee82660dac

The effects of this offsetting can be seen in our volume profile from Nov -Jan when for all intents and purposes our daily volume should remain very low (DRS and less liquidity **‚â†** more volume) but to settle FTDs volume must be generated. Yet our volume over the last cycle is up...

[This should not be the case](https://preview.redd.it/jgqcfc1if8j81.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=af47603890ac27b2f27d16786a167d198f43be47)

They actually began using XRT in late October. Finally burning it out on Jan 6th when the threshold process began.

Or so we thought.

While a threshold security cannot be shorted without a pre-borrow agreement. ETFs have no float so pre-borrowing is easy and creation/redemption can continue on the ETF regardless of it's RegSHO status. It does make it more difficult though and means more oversight of their actions.

Essentially they shorted the entirety of the Nov-Jan cycle through ETF share creation and bona-fide market making.

It was only after the RegSHO inclusion that we see GME share borrow utilization go up. You can see some evidence of this above in the negative volume index in the first section. Also here in GME short utilization after thresholding began on Jan.7th.

[GME short borrow rate, utilization, and exchange reported SI shooting up after XRT begins the threshold process.](https://preview.redd.it/ra8igl4mq8j81.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2337a2af85c1c12150232e3a9657bf1994675ee)

There is additional evidence in entropy analysis on GME and it's related ETFs, but that's another DD.

# Conclusions:

All this synthetic creation will come due and someone will be on the hook for it whether it be the ETFs, APs, or counterparties on the swap, settlement will be demanded from at-risk counterparties.

I'm bullish as fuck on the potential for these next few weeks to create massive price improvement on GME, but one step at a time. I have laid out my conservative estimate for this OPEX cycle and we will wait and see what the futures rollover period brings after that.

&#x200B;

**Now on to the part that I feel I need to discuss, in an attempt to heal the divide in this community and to defend my position here.**

# Am I a shill?

Well you're gonna hear a lot of things about me

1. **That I buy puts** : I do occasionally to protect my investment when I expect GME to go down. It's accurate, I buy OTM puts to protect my long position if I think the price of the stock is gonna drop. It's not a bet against the company it's a bet against the person who wrote the contract I purchased. If the price goes down I have more money to buy the dip. Simple as that.
2. **That I'm self-promoting and monetized**: I have been pretty transparent with my YT earnings on stream they are minimal. Some people do choose to donate it's true. But, there has never been a paywall to ask me questions or access my content. I see no reason YT should collect all the ad-revenue. If I do this for 8 hours a day there is no reason for me to not collect the ad-revenue from my work, I do not ask for donations and never have if people want to contribute I have left the option open. **If I wanted to advertise on reddit** I could pay for Reddit's advertising service and advertise my stream through reddit, on the subreddits of my choosing for a nominal fee per click, I do not.
3. **The idea I'm pushing options to sell my own covered calls**: This one is just makes no sense... the OCC creates liquidity for options trades. Guaranteeing a buyer and seller for every trade. This liquidity is provided by MMs that market the markets for each asset (Wolverine for GME). So I do not need to generate buyers of my covered calls as a matter of fact I haven't sold a covered call (for more than a couple hours) since March of 2021.
4. **I said ""most"" Superstonk users were idiots**: True, I said these five words, there is a 4 second video proving it, out of context, but accurate nonetheless. It was in response to someone describing the people that consistently bandwagon and attack me and my posts everyday in order to spin a narrative that I am profiteering on the back of apes. **I could have risen above it, I did not.**

**I have stood now for months in the face of personal attacks on my character, credibility, intelligence, and appearance. Because I chose to discuss the value of options contracts to the retail investor and their ability to generate a short squeeze scenario. The fact that I need to defend myself against these baseless claims speaks volumes about what this sub has become.**

**If their hope is that I will back down, I will not.**

**This behavior goes against the very essence of this subreddit and should be addressed.**

[It's literally Rule #1](https://preview.redd.it/sv5ymxims8j81.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f2a004580424d2c7408d6584ad085d115fb91dd)

But I have not lost faith,

I think the **vast silent majority** appreciate the knowledge and information and whether they agree or not, walk away more informed about the stock we all love.

**We can disagree, we can refute claims with evidence or proof to the contrary. We can discuss but we should never attack. The claims levied against me and other DD writers have been just that, attacks.**

**When we fight amongst ourselves nobody walks away a winner.**

I personally have, posted copious amounts of DD and Daily updates **every** trading for the last 10, almost 11 months now. I have given my perspective on GME and it's price movements. I have reached out in good faith and collaborated with others that were attempting to do the same. I have published all this information here on reddit, I have never withheld information behind a paywall or forced people to watch my stream.

Everything you can learn from me about GME **can be found here, for free**.

I have made predictions, have they always been right, **absolutely not**. The stock market is a chaotic system a prediction on an outcome can change the nature of that outcome.

But every wrong estimate moves us closer to the ones that are correct and lifts the curtain on the actions of SHFs. Price predictions are always a toss up but the underlying mechanics that drive GME price movement are testable and backed by data.

&#x200B;

>Columbia University emeritus professor of philosophy Philip Kitcher, a good scientific theory has three characteristics. First, it has unity, which means it consists of a limited number of problem-solving strategies that can be applied to a wide range of scientific circumstances. Second, a good scientific theory leads to new questions and new areas of research. This means that a theory doesn't need to explain everything in order to be useful. And finally, a good theory is formed from a number of hypotheses that can be tested independently from the theory itself.

&#x200B;

I write this in defense of myself and others who do not wish to step forward, or cannot.

To attack the people who have dedicated countless hours of their lives to bring information to the community is completely despicable, whether you agree with the information, or not. Many of these people have sacrificed countless hours of their lives. Losing time with family and loved ones. To bring things to light that never would have been know to have a contingent of people allowed on this sub to openly insult, intimidate, and harass them.

I don't think I need to name them, they are made obvious by their comments and posts.

Those seeking to divide us are not apes.

I also wanted to share my own clip, and maybe this will give a better idea of my views on this whole situation and motivations.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down by 454 points, or 1.3%. S&P 500 futures slid 1.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by 2.4%.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine, potentially undercutting peace talks with President Joe Biden. That announcement was followed by news that Biden was set to order sanctions on separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union vowing to take additional measures.

Putin later ordered forces into the two breakaway regions.

The news came after the White House said Sunday that Biden has accepted ‚Äúin principle‚Äù to meet with Putin in yet another effort to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine situation via diplomacy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit between the two leaders would occur after a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov

WH3 development and WH2 support were handled by different teams and it really hurts WH3,totalwar,2353,sy0fau,https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/sy0fau/wh3_development_and_wh2_support_were_handled_by/,668,1645467644.0,"I'm gonna talk about three aspects that important to me and WH3 dropping the ball in those areas currently. Those are:

1. Character traits

2. Character skills

3. Technology

I finished Kislev campaign ans started Ogre Kingdoms, only briefly inspected tech tree and character traits and skills for other races, so my knowledge might be incomplete, nevertheless:

**1. Character traits.**

WH3 dev team made really weird decision with starting character traits. First of all, roughly 2 years ago several generic traits in WH2 got massive buffs (Tough, Weapon Master, Aggressive, Strong) some got visible buffs (Fleet-footed, Confident). That was WH2 devs reaction to imbalance among starting traits - some were ignored by players in favor of very strong ones (Disciplined and Knowledgeable mostly). WH3 dev team did a complete 180 on these changes, but not only those generic traits were reverted back to their mostly useless pre-buff state, new race-specific traits for WH3 races were consciously designed to be... bad, really bad.

Quick example, Ogre Kingdoms race-specific traits, there's only five:

Maw Preacher: -1 corruption (local province)

Farter: +4%(!) speed

Big Daddy: +3(!!!) Charge Bonus

Flabby: +15% unit mass

Deboner: +10% meat gained from battles (best of all race-specific OK traits, but still nearly useless - it gives 1 additional meat on average).

Just for the reference, generic Aggressive trait after buff was giving +8 Charge Bonus and +10% Weapon Strength in WH2 and still was overlooked in favor of more powerful ones.

Kislev has its fair share of bad traits, but also has one (conditionally) good, although situational - Strongholder: +5 Melee Defense to all units in army when in own territory. Obviously gives nothing during offensive sieges, conquest of new territories or inside Realms of Chaos, but strong trait to clean up own territory.

Another issue with character traits, probably caused by new design of character's 'Details' screen - it's no longer possible to learn how any specific trait was obtained by mousovering that trait in 'Details' screen. It's now possible only in Event Messages window in the main campaign screen (the turn you got this specific trait). Which is probably oversight, because it's perfectly visible how specific followers were obtained in the very same 'Details' screen (very good addition btw). There's no new generic traits anyway, but all old ones were for some reason renamed. For instance Builder/Engineer/Architect became Constructor/Creator/Master Mason with zero changes to functionality.

If these changes (no tooltip information about the way traits were obtained) is conscious decision and not a bug, than it's no wonder why new character defeat traits don't have any cool names, but all named ""Defeated so and so"" instead. At least by glancing at those traits player would know how he got one.

Traits for fighting multiple battle vs specific races in a weird place. It gives +3 Leadership to army for all WH3 races, but +5 for all WH1 and WH2 races. Most likely explanation - WH3 dev team got trait table from WH2 before majority of the fixes (buffs and nerfs) were done in WH2 (roughly 2 years prior to WH3 release) and never bothered to align those numbers with WH2 in its finished state.

Side note about Cathay character traits - they might look like completely unique race-specific traits, but they're not (in most cases). It's generic traits with additional Yin and Yang bonuses slapped on. For example, Disciplined (+2 MA/+2 Leadership to all units in army) got +3 Yin and became 'Trained', Fleet-footed (+15% Speed and Strider attribute) got +3 Yin and became 'Fleet of Foot' and so on. There's also several unique traits, but they're weakest of all Cathay traits, for instance Fervent Questioner: -1 Corruption/+3 Yang.

**2. Character skills.**

I hope players noticed that red-line skills (or Battle Skills how game defines those) received nerf. Generally Rank 3 of 1st tier was granting +8 MA or +8 MD (sometimes both) to specific infantry units in WH2, in WH3 Rank 3 gives only +6 MA and +6 MD. Also nerfed amount of Missile strength (from 12% to 8-9%) and reload time reduction (from 15% to 9%) for infantry units at rank 3.

There's currently bug (or probably intentional design decision, who knows) with Greasus and generic Tyrants and it needs longer explanation. Roughly one year into WH2 post-production CA buffed non-caster lords, making their Character Skills (yellow line) only 2 skill-points deep (from 3 skill-points deep at WH2 release). It's still true in WH3 for all non-caster generic and legendary lords, with the exception of Tyrants and Greasus (they share this yellow line). No explanation was given yet.

P.S. Oh, yeah, almost forgot - Route Marcher nerfed from 10% to 5% across the board. Most popular skill which everyone invests their 1st skill point in? Yeah, you can't have that.

**3. Technology**

It's bad. It's really-really bad, for all races in WH3 without exception. New tech-trees are just incomparable to best of WH2 tech-trees, still gonna do it, just to to put it in numbers.

Let's compare tech for Sisters of Avelorn in HE tech tree with the Ice Guard tech in Kislev tech tree

Sisters of Avelorn: +20% ammunition/+10% Missile strength, +10 Armour, +5% Speed, +2 Recruit rank, +6 MD/+5% Physical resistance. Spread over five different technologies (which buffs multiple units at once).

Ice Guard: +10% Ammunition, +15% Ammunition, +10 Missile resistance (for Rank 7+ units), 3 technologies, one is exclusive for Ice Guard.

But most outrageous example is Tzar Guard - single tech, which gives them +4 Leadership. And this design philosophy - only one tech per unit, is mostly true for all races with few exceptions. For instance, Elemental Bear gets buffs from 4 different (and exclusive!) technologies.

In all honesty, old, pre-rework Greenskins tech tree was giving more to their units, than current new Kislev tech tree. I dare to say that even Warriors of Chaos tech tree in WH2 (which was barely changed since WH1) gave more substantial buffs to their units than ANY new WH3 tech tree currently gives to theirs. I don't understand this design decision and surely don't like it.

**TL;DR:** Traits, skills and tech in WH3 needs another pass and substantial buffs to become comparable to their WH2 counterparts. I just hope that CA wouldn't do the opposite and nerf WH2 races instead.",0.92

A good friend of mine who used to no life the game with me in college but doesn‚Äôt really play a lot anymore, they will jump in each expansion and play a bit, but very very casual. Anyway he hit me up and said he is thinking about jumping into 9.2 and did some light research on the endgame systems and asked me to explain how everything worked and after my long borderline incoherent diatribe on the systems I was like holy shit, this is really not new/returning player friendly. 

The conversation went something like this‚Ä¶ (Ace Ventura long inhale preparing to say a lot of words fast)

Ok, so you level your toon to 60, then you choose a covenant, this will grant you a class specific ability and a covenant ability. Then you want to farm this thing called renown. You can farm it by doing different forms of content, dungeons, raids, pvp, covenant campaign. 

Then once you progress with that you will start unlocking these things called soul binds, basically a talent tree like system, only to unlock the talents you need to find these things called conduits that are basically the abilities that you equip to the talent tree. The conduits are found from all forms of content as well, specific bosses from dungeons, world quests, etc. These conduits have an item level too, so doing higher level content you can find higher level versions of them or you can farm a currency in this zone called Korthia that will upgrade a random one to your highest ilvl of a conduit obtained. 

You also need to run something called torghast, it‚Äôs rougelike piece of content that gives a currency used to craft you legendary items, yes you craft your legendary items now, they used to have cap on how much of the currency you can get, not anymore, you can farm it all you want. To craft a legendary you need the currency from Torghast, a base item that is made by players, it costs gold. These things called missives you buy from players, these let you choose the stats you want on the legendary item. THEN you need the memory, it‚Äôs the actual legendary effect you attach the item. These are found like conduits, certain bosses from dungeons and raids will drop them, wings of Torghast or you can buy some with honor and other currencies.

Ok, that‚Äôs pretty much it, once you got your soulbinds, conduits, and leggo you can start going after higher end content, higher M+ keys, raiding, ranked pvp etc‚Ä¶

My friend‚Äôs response‚Ä¶nah i‚Äôm good.

And honestly, I couldn‚Äôt blame him. So for the love of all that is holy Blizzard, please cool down the fucking systems in 10.0. I know we will never get back to how it was in pre legion expansions‚Ä¶just hit max level‚Ä¶.and that‚Äôs pretty much it, start gearing up. But man, this shit is getting out of hand.",0.91

The facts.

The ugly facts.

First: The Atrekna are not interesting in communicating despite multiple attempts at communication. We know they understand us, we know they can hear us, they simply only have one statement and one statement only.

""You Belong to Us""

With that in mind, all attempts at establishing diplomatic relations have failed, meaning there are no diplomatic discussions with the Atrekna.

We know it is possible to have discussions with them, we have video evidence from an unnamed source of the Lanaktallan, Mantid, and Atrekna communicating prior to the First Precursor War.

And to satisfy your curiosity, the cube is a propaganda piece talking about how the Lanaktallan, Mantid, and Atrekna are embarking on a grand project to ensure your species will survive any potential disaster as well as properly utilize the resources of the universe.

No.

I have.

I just made Trea aware of it a few months back when his researchers were working on cracking the phasic crystal information network system.

It took four black projects to crack that datacube but the Atrekna portion was missing.

Trea was forced to do a black box project to crack the Atrekna section.

I then put the data in another black box project. With the loss of Black Box Prime there's some slowdown in research, but the Confederacy is big enough that even with the Terran Xenocide Event, we had the researchers to work on it.

Trea? The floor is yours.

\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---

TREANA'AD HIVE WORLDS

So, the Atrekna refuse to communicate, refuse all diplomatic attempts.

That's point one.

LEEBAW CONTEMPLATION POOL

What's point two?

\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---

I was getting to that.

Anyway.

Point Two is the fact they use temporal replication and movement. This mastery of temporal mechanics is how they move from place to place. Meaning that anywhere they are, they can move to anyplace that has or eventually will intersect with the place they are at that time. This is instantaneous travel that can only be blocked with temporal stabilizers.

Point Three: The Atrekna prefer to 'sink' systems into space by unknown methods. Stellar stabilizers and temporal stabilizers can return the system back to realspace, but they prefer to change the star from yellow to red, to extend out the life. Inside the system time moves faster relative to the rest of us, allowing them time to do research, repopulate, and respawn their military.

Point Four: We can spot, in real time, when and where a system is sunk. As nearly as the science has figured, a system being sunk emits a shower of chronotrons and spooky particles detectable as far away as the Hammerhead Galaxy in real time. This has allowed us to pinpoint the systems currently held by the Atrekna. The system also emits a constant stream of spooky particles detectable at ranges of thousands of light years. They aren't as hidden as they think they are.

Point Four: They xenocide any race in the system. Those that aren't xenocided are reduced to primitivism, are genetically altered, and used as food and gestation.

Which brings us to our next point.

Point Five: While Atrekna prisoners have shown to be able to eat standard diets, including photoplankton and yeast products, they, universally, desire meat and fungus. The meat, they prefer to be alive when harvested. Worse, universally, the Atrekna prefer to use their unique mouth design to remove the scalp and skull, which they crush as they swallow it to act as grinding plates in their stomach, then remove the brain and swallow it whole.

While living.

Point Six: While the Atrekna can implant their larvae in the abdomen on nonsentient and or non-sapient animals they universally prefer intelligence, living sentient beings for implantation, including their own species. The higher the phasic ability, the more coveted they are. The sole exception being Terrans, which appear to be as toxic to them as they are to other species.

Point Six Point Five: It is universally fatal to be implanted with Atrekna larvae.

Point Seven: Any captured planets are immediately xenoformed to the Atrekna's preferences, which is a dim red sun, fungal forests and blooms, and little to no weather, regardless of the effect on native species.

Point Eight: Planets captured are often used as Dwellerspawn breeding areas, often feeding the native species to the Dwellerspawn until they are extinct.

Point Nine: Gas giants are used to create autonomous war machines as well as the larger Dwellerspawn that usually engage naval vessels.

Point Ten: Any system is eventually entirely harvested. There has been multiple cases of stellar systems resurfacing to reveal nothing more than a dying sun and some gravel where the planets were and with wisps of vapor where gas giants were. This means that time is of the essence.

Point Eleven: They believe that the entire universe is theirs, that anyone living in it is just food or in the way.

Point Twelve: The Atrekna are not from our universe, our reality. They are invaders. They have no place in our universe prior to their arrival.

Point Thirteen: Without diplomatic methods to achieve a cease fire or peace treaty, the Atrekna have no reason to stop their activities and have shown they can only be forced to stop through force of arms.

Point Fourteen: They are responsible for the Terran Xenocide Event, displaying their willingness to xenocide one of our member species.

Is everyone agreed on these points?

Power.

\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---

TREANA'AD HIVE WORLDS

Before we get too far afield.

There is a reason that these points have been brought up.

...

The Spoked Offensive has been stalled. The Atrekna have in their full possession only two hundred nineteen worlds. There is still fighting on another two thousand, but the Atrekna forces are steadily losing since the Wemterran Agony Event three moths ago disrupted their ability to temporally replicate troops and war materiel.

The Confederacy is now counter-attacking, with the help of all members, no matter what their status is, who wish to take part.

Which means the following question must be put forth, and must be weighed and deliberated on.

...

Due to the above facts, primarily the prime fact that the Atrekna refuse to communicate or engage in diplomatic talks, is everyone aware that the outcome can only be one of two things:

We are all defeated and subjugated by the Atrekna.

The Atrekna are xenocided.

There can be no 1% Line here. They refuse diplomatic talks and any group larger than four can move troops as well as temporally replicate deceased Atrekna, making it impossible to create and enforce a 1% Line.

This war is one of xenocide.

This is not like our disagreement with the Lanaktallan Unified Council, which was willing to engage in diplomatic talks and despite the risks of later betrayal, was willing to surrender.

They will not talk to us.

They view us as food and a means to make more of themselves.

Elder members, you have faced this kind of decision before.

The Mar-gite.

Due to the refusal to vote upon action at that time, I have requested a mandatory vote of yay or nay by each member.

For you younger members, I must remind you: This is a war of xenocide. If we lose, our species will be gone from the universe for all time.

This vote is to authorize Overproject Nandeval to be used against the Atrekna.

You have one week to deliberate and discuss among yourselves. Due to the fact I am the Questioner in this case, I will recuse myself from Gestalt operations for one week unless a major event takes place.

Ladies, gentlemen, both, neither, either, xir, zir, and sle, this question is the foremost important question we can take up.

With the loss of the Confederate Senate and the Confederate House of Ministers, as well as the Confederate Lord Minister and the Confederate High Judicial Board, we are empowered and obligated to put this question forth for the survival of our peoples.

It will be a secret vote, recorded only by CONFEDINTEL for archival records, the archives to be sealed for no less than one thousand and one years.

Weigh your decision carefully, fellow amalgamations of species desire and will.

You must decide a set of two questions.

Can the Atrekna co-exist with our species.

If no: Are you wiling to xenocide them.

If yes: How? All evidence, which is fully reviewable by all parties and has a label of mandatory public dissemination, gives no clue as how our species and the Atrekna can co-exist  beyond a master/slave predator/prey devourer/food relationship.

A final piece of evidence must be considered.

The Terran Descent Humans have already been xenocided. They are an extinct species.

\>display TDH.pop.int

\>>2.7376000E+4

That's all of them. The number drops each day.

The Atrekna have already displayed their willingness to xenocide us.

Is anyone willing to make a rebuttal?

...

...

...

Let the record show that no member species was willing to make a rebuttal at this time. A rebuttal may be made prior to voting, immediately prior to the vote after the call for vote has been made, or immediately after voting has finished and been tabulated.

With that said, the TREANA'AD SPECIES GESTALT INTELLIGENCE will be suspended for one weeks.

PUBVIAN DOMINION

Nandeval is a Pubvian word, an old word.

In our old religion from before we set aside religion, the religious texts spoke of a war at the end of reality.

The Nandeval.

It was here the stars would go out one by one, devoured by a creature that devoured all things. The peoples would fight monstrous creatures but one by one fall, city by city, nation by nation.

At the end of it, the stars would go out and the universe itself would die.

*Nandeval shall fall upon us*

*In silence at first in the sky*

*The servants of Nandeval shall swarm*

*from darkness they come and are born*

*All shall fall devoured and slain*

*Tribe, city, nation and clan*

*The hidden among us shall reveal*

*its hunger with tooth claw and maw*

*Betrayed from within and without*

*Each Pubvian shall be devoured*

*When all is dark*

*And silence reigns*

*The universe itself shall die*

*At the hands of Nandeval*

That's the last stanzas of the religious texts.

Yeah, yeah, I know, it REALLY looks like some kind of warning about the Atrekna.

I need some time to think.

To be honest, I'm going to tell you. We were xenocided once already, I don't think my people are really willing to be xenocided again.

The way she described it was that it was like being fucked by an animal, since they operate on instinct when it comes to sex. Most are chronic masturbators and are desensitized to sustained contact, so retards fuck hard and long, and they‚Äôre very selfish in bed. She enjoyed seducing them and the way they reacted when she let on that she was serious and wanted them to mount her. She told me that she never used condoms when she had sex with retards, not because she liked them, but because it was degrading and thrilling for such a terribly misshapen person to cum inside of her and get her pregnant. According to her, she had aborted 15 retard babies over the years. Think about that. Think about how much sex with retards she had to have been having to get knocked up with downy sperm 15 times. she was incredibly hot even at 45 but after knowing that possibly a hundred or more retards had their way with her and had cum inside her, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to have sex with her.

Lol!) that was vitally time sensitive for the customer. Can't tell you how many times they begged me to fix it NOW because they have a hard publishing deadline overnight or within hours or a day (think major daily newspapers, periodical magazines, etc). I never had problems with this personally and always did whatever it took to get them going again. And I'd submit my time sheets at work (signed off by the customer) to show the overtime worked. Heck, the customer was paying every penny of the OT.

But then, my Service Mangler told me they would no longer pay me for OT worked and I MUST ONLY log time sheets with regular hours. I told them this would screw the customer but he didn't care and said the order came from ""upstairs"".

So that's what I did. The customers were livid, but I refused to work past 5 PM or nights or weekends or start early. If I wasn't going to get paid, they weren't going to get service. Boss's orders.

After a couple of weeks my boss called me in for a disciplinary chat about being a ""clock watcher"" and that customers were complaining about this. I told him point blank ""no money, no workee"" according to company policy HE insisted on - and gave him the date and time and my personal record of his instructions that I made of his orders on the day. I told him as I told him then that I was personally happy to work overtime if paid, but I CANNOT FALSIFY COMPANY RECORDS by working outside the allocated work hours (including job travel time) and not record the actual time worked. So according to company policy I cannot even volunteer my time after hours.

I was the lead service engineer for that company. So you can be sure the other engineers were watching this very carefully.

Twenty minutes after it started it turned into the most intense pain I have ever felt complete with sweating and vomiting. My friends drove me to the ER where I waited for three hours in complete agony before I was seen. The doctor seemed pretty unconcerned and told me I had acid reflux, without asking about my pain or doing blood work. I told him how painful it was for me and he told me he had it one time and it really hurt too. It could be noted at this point that I am 20 year old Latina woman, and the doctor did ask where I was really from. 

I was pretty freaked out- but whatever life goes on. My mom said that it didn't sound like acid reflux and I should really get it checked out, but I told her the doctor said I was fine and had acid reflux and it wasn't a big deal and I had nothing to worry about. 

Two weeks later the pain started again, not quite as bad but still horribly painful. I thought it was acid reflux and would be gone after I took my medicine. It did not. After 8 hours of suffering waiting it to go away, and it only getting worse I gave in and went to the ER again. 

This time I was seen pretty quickly and the doctor was pretty unconcerned when I said I was here previously for the same issue and was told acid reflux. He said because I was just here and had bloodwork done I had nothing to worry about. I told him that I had not done any blood work and he suddenly seemed a little more concerned about me. 

After a blood and urine test they found that my enzymes were not at the right levels and ordered a sonogram. They determined that I had gallstones and needed my gallbladder out. It was a Saturday morning and they discharged me with a hydrocodone prescription and told me to call the hospital on Monday to schedule a an appointment to see if I could get the surgery soon.

About 12 hours later I am in crippling pain yet again, the hydrocodone did absolutely nothing for my pain and I am forced to return to the emergency room again. The nurses took blood and once again seemed unconcerned. 

After more bloodwork they found out that I was getting much worse and admitted me to the hospital. I ended up needing two surgeries and stayed in the hospital for 4 days(for comparison most people just need the surgery and return home the same day). My mom had to fly in, rent a car, and get a hotel to take care of me. I missed an entire week of my college classes and I am shuddering thinking of the bills from my three ER trips, two surgeries, and four days in the hospital. 

TL;DR Trusted a first opinion from an ER doctor and ignored my moms advice and ended up hospitalized for several days for a simple issue.",0.97

The party was sent to deal with some unknown ghostly haunting that was affecting a nearby village and had killed a few inhabitants. After some investigation, the party was camped out in the middle of the woods next to a decrepit cottage and as night fell we heard some wailing and a figure approached from over the trees.

There were a few hints along the way and at this point I realized out of game that we were facing a banshee. In game I asked the DM if I could roll arcana to see if I knew what a banshee was and if it was immune to the charmed condition. I rolled very well and with bardic inspiration I got a 27. The DM said that I knew about banshees and that they were not immune to being charmed. My character realized that this banshee could use its wail ability and potentially kill one or several people in the party. I cast suggestion on the banshee and it failed its save. I suggested the reasonable course of action that it should go kill the villagefolk that it already hated rather than us.

Naturally it went to the area with the greatest civillian population and used its wail ability. By the time we caught up to it, eight people were dead. My character knew it could only wail once a day so we came in and killed it easily.

Just sharing because I didn't realize how awful that was until after doing it and it came as a shock to me. I am oddly proud of myself.

TL;DR: My character sacrificed eight innocent bystanding NPCs to reduce a threat to the party.",0.92

When we love books and buy a lot, yet we don‚Äôt have the time or energy to read them because life is so busy.

If it were possible, I would just want to spend most of my days being able to read books. That would be awesome for me. But of course, that‚Äôs not reality. We have work, school, responsibilities and obligations. Bills to pay. It‚Äôs tough. 

Thankfully I only buy books secondhand. I don‚Äôt buy new. I usually go to used bookstores in my area, Goodwill, and sometimes the mini shops in local libraries. I also use Thriftbooks.com. I could get about 11 books for the price of 1 new hardcover. 

How do you all feel about this? Is it something that makes you yearn to just drop everything and read?

EDIT: I should also mention that I will probably have to buy another bookshelf because my other ones are getting full. LOL.",0.92
