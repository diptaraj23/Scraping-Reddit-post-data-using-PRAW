It then closes and opens Spotify by the os module and plays it via pynput.

There have been a few programs in this subreddit which offer a similar functionality but mute spotify, and play another locally-stored song. I preferred not using that method and hence did this.

The code is present below, and is also present in my github repo [here](https://github.com/SakDev/SpotiByeBye).

Once again, I truly would appreciate any constructive feedback!

Also, stay posted for my next course, Python Pandas For Your Grandpa.

**UPDATE** since this post blew up.  

1.  After >1 year of having a YouTube channel, I had 59 subscribers. I posted this 16 hours ago and now I have 325 subscribers and counting. Two people even *purchased* my course. Like, what!?!? Thank you!  
2.  *Please* stay posted for my next course Python Pandas For Your Grandpa. It's nearly finished after months of work, and the production quality is much better.

**UPDATE 2**  
My [course on Pandas](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/python-pandas-for-your-grandpa/) has been released!  ([View on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9oKUrtC4VP7ry0um1QOUUfJBXKnkf-dA))",0.99
"Hello, world! I'm Al Sweigart, author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. AMA!",Python,2494,otbvoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/otbvoj/hello_world_im_al_sweigart_author_of_automate_the/,541,1627485107.0,"Howdy, y'all. I'm Al Sweigart (rhymes with ""why dirt""), author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. I release all of my books under a Creative Commons license, so you can read them for free on my website at https://inventwithpython.com

My latest books are [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) and [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I'm currently working on a book about recursion (the recursion jokes get funnier every time I hear them) which should be available in 2022. The ideas for this book grew into [a 2018 North Bay Python talk I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE).

""Big Book"" contains the source code for 81 games, puzzles, simulations, and animations that were designed to be short and simple to understand. Folks tend to get caught up in repeating yet another ""hello world"" tutorial, but don't quite know how to apply the programming concepts they learned into actual programs. This book is full of source code that they can study to see how real-world programs work. They aren't just code snippets but actual, runnable programs. If you've been told you should ""work on your projects"" but don't know where to start, or if you've been told ""look at the source code of open source projects"" but found them undocumented and inscrutable, check out these programs.

""Beyond the Basic Stuff"" is a sort of follow up to ""Automate the Boring Stuff"" (or any other beginner Python resource). It goes into how professionals write code and best practices they follow. There's information on how to find help on your own, how to format your code and name your variables, an explanation of common programming jargon, the basics of Git, three chapters on object-oriented programming (and more importantly, when and why to use OOP), and more.

You've probably seen [my posts at the start of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/obq0cg/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_online/) when I make my online Python course free. About 15,000 to 30,000 people sign up each month, though according to my stats only about 5% of people actually complete the course (which is typical for online courses, free or paid).

I got started writing programming books in 2009 when my then-girlfriend was a nanny for kid who wanted to learn to program. I started writing a book (which would become Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python) and self-published. People liked it, so I kept writing, and Automate was my first book through a traditional publisher, No Starch Press. I quit my software developer job in 2013 to finish writing Automate, thinking I'd get another software dev job in a year. But I kept having more ideas for other books, tutorials, videos, etc. so I'm still here writing.

Ask me anything! Post your questions and upvote questions you find interesting, and at 2pm central I'll begin replying.

EDIT (4:30pm Central) Wow, I've been typing nonstop for two and a half hours. I'm going to take a quick break and then keep going. Thanks for the questions, everyone!

EDIT 2: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I'm also creating a 56-video Udemy course for the Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python book as well. [So far I only have the first 15 videos done, but you can watch them on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSrnLbioN6w&list=PL0-84-yl1fUmeV_2bBSguF_S0TVZk8wow)

EDIT (7:00pm) Heh, wow another two hours flew by. I'm going to drive home and then maybe answer a few more. Thanks again, everyone!

EDIT (10:30pm) Calling it a night. I'll probably answer a few more tomorrow, but I have to get back to work. Thanks again, everyone! Oh, and if you can help me out, writing an (honest) Amazon review for my books (especially the latest two) or even just sharing the links to the free online copies would be really help me get them in front of more people.",0.98
