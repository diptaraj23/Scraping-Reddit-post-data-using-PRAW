Ruminations on the problem of None.,Python,1,sy42f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/sy42f5/ruminations_on_the_problem_of_none/,3,1645476674.0,"I think this function smells:

```
def read_value(key):

        return db.read(key)
    except (ObscureDBError, VeryObscureDBError, NotSoObscureButStillObsureDbError):
        return None
```
We try to free the users of our function from worrying about all the sorts of DB Error. But the user still needs to care that the value can be None. And if we allow the function to raise an exception, that smell stays: nothing forces or even urges the users of our function to handle a possible error case. They need to read the docs or the source code to even know that the function can make errors. Maybe typing would make a suggestion that the output value can be None, if our users use IDE that warns about such things. 

But I want a more robust protection. So now, I'd write this function like this:
```
def read_value(key):
    try:
        return (db.read(key), True)
    except (ObscureDBError, VeryObscureDBError, NotSoObscureButStillObsureDbError):
        return (None, False)
```
By returning the tuple instead of the supposed value, I force the users of my function to acknowledge it. If they erroneously suppose that read_value() always returns the value, they will get some type mismatch as soon as they use the value. If, however, I'd return a value or None, the type mismatch would only happen on error. And if the error is really obscure, even the unittests may fail to cover that case.

1. Very simple use. Checkpoint provides a very simple command-line interface that abstracts unnecessary details for the user while retaining its usability
2. A minimal yet very functional GUI (uses React, Electron) comes prepackaged with the tool.
3. Exposes all the functionality through the python package allowing the user to write his/her custom GUI if the current one doesn’t satisfy them.
4. Support for custom extension readers. Checkpoint allows addition of custom reader classes that can be used to read certain file extensions, can even validate the content of the file s before reading them.

You can install checkpoint using pip install pycheckpoint. Any feedback or possible improvements/features would be highly appreciated.

Async IO Tasks vs. Threads,Python,7,sxovwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/sxovwp/async_io_tasks_vs_threads/,15,1645433431.0,"I recently heard of this feature in Python3.7+ where the asyncio brought a thing called ""tasks"" which people refer to as background tasks. So that's may first question:
1. Do these tasks really run in background?

Also, when comparing asyncio tasks to threads in Python, we know that python has a GIL. So, there's nothing like parallel. I know the difference in core structure i.e. asyncio tasks run in an event loop inside the same thread, while python threads are simply forked threads. But when it comes to speed, none of these are parallel.

We can call them concurrent instead. So the second question is:

2. Which of these two would be faster? 


A few things I got to know about memory consumption is:
 - Threads consume a fair amount of data since each thread needs to have its own stack. With async code, all the code shares the same stack and the stack is kept small due to continuously unwinding the stack between tasks.
 - Threads are OS structures and therefore require more memory for the platform to support. There is no such problem with asynchronous tasks.

Building advanced neural networks, coordinating several network models, data processing, designing a concise workflow, and handling a large volume of training-related data are all time-consuming processes. Keras and TFLearn are two tools that can help with this development process since they enable flexibility and abstraction for numerous connected modalities. Another tool that is fast gaining popularity is TensorLayer, a Python-based machine learning tool.

The progress of deep learning is being hampered by the increase in interaction. Developers must devote a significant amount of time to integrating components for experimenting with neural networks, handling intermediate training stages, organizing training-related data, and allowing hyperparameter change in response to diverse events.

I created a generator for a dactyl-manuform style keyboard in Python, using either solidpython / OpenSCAD or cadquery / OpenCASCADE, depending on your settings.  The components are designed to be customized and 3D printed.  

I thought this might be helpful for anyone looking to do programmatic geometry generation.  The code was translated from clojure and evolved so it is not the cleanest, but does show techniques for generation.  The refactor branch is much closer to what I would do if I had started from scratch where features are separated for easier customization and expansion of capabilities.  I would suggest starting there if you are more interested in the code than the actual keyboard.  It should be merged into the master branch in the near future.

* “Sometimes you just want to be loved and you just want to be loved and then you have to fight for your love.”
* “I do not know if i could be in love with someone as beautiful as you”
* “Love is the highest power in the universe”
* “I have had the pleasure of seeing you, and i am glad to have you back.”

**Sometimes, our AI turns out to be a great motivator:**

* “If you’re feeling hurt, give yourself time to heal.”
* “Do not let yourself be discouraged.”
* “I am the light of my life. i am the light that always shines brightly”
* “It is as simple as that : when you say you are sorry, no matter what your response is, you feel it. when you say you are happy, no matter what you say, you are living a beautiful life.”

**Sometimes, it turns out to be depressing:**

* “Love is like a dream. it is like a dream that can never be fulfilled.”
* “I love you so much i am afraid i will never see you again.”
* “Sometimes we get what we need. sometimes it comes too late. “

**Sometimes, it’s just eh idk:**

* “If you never really loved anyone, you were never likely to get along well. you were a pretty fucking pathetic little ass to me because you were the only one who really had the heart to live up to your own ridiculous expectations.”
* “i would rather die than live in a world where i am a prisoner of the law.”

This is my 3rd developer job (I am self-taught) and have 2.5 years of experience, but the first job where I work with relatively big existent code base. 

 The problems:

1. there is nearly no documentation to the project, there are only some vague comments in code. They also use some self-written ""connector"" around PyMongo client - no docs!
2. the company use technologies which I have not worked with GraphQL, MongoDB. (I told on interview that I did not work with the techs)
3. Manager (never worked as programmer himself and have no coding skills) does not give me any time to learn the technologies and read the project code, instead I spend all my working time on meetings, doing some internal learning (not even related to programming). On the other hand he wants me to start writing code as fast as possible, he told me on the second working day that he expects me to start writing code in 2-3 days.

The project is not really large (about 50K-60K SLOC in Python), but no docs, strange internal libraries (e.g. sync PyMongo used with async AioHTTP).

How can I explain the manager that I need at least 1-2 weeks of reading code and learning new technologies to do something in the project? How much time did it get you to start writing code in a new job ?",0.81

# Background

I have a terrible history with making sound financial decisions. When I was younger, I spent my money almost as soon as I got it, leaving me continuously illiquid (even when I had the fortune of getting good income). To help me get better at this important part of an individual’s well-being, I bought a book called *Get a Financial Life* by Beth Kobliner and set out to get better. This script is just one stop on my path to financial well-being,  mostly serving as a way to quantify my gut-feeling on how much spending is appropriate given my income.

# Pybudget

You can find the source code here: [https://github.com/Adri6336/pybudget](https://github.com/Adri6336/pybudget)

Pybudget is a command line tool for Linux (currently only tested on a Debian/Ubuntu based distro) and Windows systems. You call it and pass a numerical value as an argument (this value represents your income). Once it gets this value, it checks its configuration files (one for determining the percent you’ll save or invest, and the other for adding up expenses) and calculates a budget for you. The budget is then outputted to the terminal.

I wrote it to put most of its operations into discrete functions , and tried to comment it up nicely. My hope was write it in a much less spaghetti manner, so that I could easily improve it over time and have it be easily understood by others who read it. I don’t know if I did a terribly good job at this, so if you got any notes, I’d be ecstatic to receive them!

# Why is This Relevant to Python

This script makes use of Python’s sys.exit, sys.argv, os.system, os.path, and decimal modules,  providing an example use case for them. In addition, it makes extensive use of Python’s try-except functionality, uses string formatting (e.g. ‘%.02f’ % float), string splitting, for-loop iteration, with-file-opening, function declaration, and tuple use.

I am releasing [dude](https://github.com/roniemartinez/dude). It is a web scraping framework with a simple syntax inspired by Flask. You can build a minimal scraper with just a few lines of code.

```python
from dude import select


@select(selector=""a"")
def get_links(element):
    return {""url"": element.get_attribute(""href"")}
```

To install simply run `pip install pydude`.
To start scraping, run `dude scrape --url ""<url>"" path/to/file.py --output result.json`.

More details about the usage are in the [Github project repo](https://github.com/roniemartinez/dude#basic-usage).

### Features:
- Simple Flask-inspired design - build a scraper with decorators.
- Uses Playwright's API - run your scraper in Chrome, Firefox and Webkit and leverage Playwright's powerful selector engine.
- Data grouping - group related scraping data.
- URL pattern matching - run functions on specific URLs.
- Priority - reorder functions based on priority.
- Setup function - enable setup steps (clicking dialogs or login).
- Navigate function - enable navigation steps to move to other pages.
- Custom storage - option to save data to other formats or database.
- Async support - write async handlers.

### Contribute

Dude is at a very early stage. I invite everyone interested in web scraping to contribute by opening bug reports, feature requests, pull requests and discussions. Your help is highly appreciated!",0.77

I made a chord progression suggester,Python,2,swu5o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/swu5o1/i_made_a_chord_progression_suggester/,0,1645336319.0,"I'm copying my post over from r/musicproduction, super excited to release my first program!

""""""This is my first ever program, I started working on it early last month! It has a bank of around 7,500 MIDI files that you can shuffle through randomly and send one to your DAW when you find one you like. 

It's all coded in python, except for the styling I used for the themes. Those are from a 3rd party resource coded in tcl. The program was inspired from a comment I saw a while back where someone shared a massive folder of .mid files. All I did was code an interface for shuffling them. With that being said, given how many progressions there are, there's some really awesome ones you might not think of, and some bland ones! 

As I get more experienced with coding I'd like to add the ability to omit certain progressions. For example, if you want to entirely remove the possibility of a I-I-I-I or a I-IV-vi-V. Or, to only include the ones you specify. For right now it's pretty simple!

Here's a video of it in action https://imgur.com/a/uXEZV8a

It has a light and dark theme, defaulted to dark. I created the icon as well. Coding this was a lot of fun and I'd like to pursue coding further. You can grab it from my github https://github.com/coal-fingers/Chordial just download the ""Chordial.zip"" (everything else is just the main contents of that zip file) and once you unzip it, just run ""Chordial.exe""! I did not create an installer, but you can easily link a shortcut to the program if you like it. If you guys want ONLY the .mid files, then feel free to download just the ""Midi Progressions.zip""

If you guys make something using this be sure to leave a link so I can check it out! BTW, the program IS coded to close by default when you send a file to the DAW! If you have any questions, check the README.txt first! Thanks for trying it out!""""""",0.75

* [Follow Along on Blog](https://tech.gerardbentley.com/intermediate/streamlit/python/2022/02/13/python-form-generator.html)

With this Proof of Concept app, we'll walk through how to build a basic Streamlit input form, then add validation with Pydantic, and finally use those skills to bootstrap new input forms!

I like the simplicity of Streamlit's form input widgets, and really like the connection to Pydantic input validation with the aptly named [Streamlit-Pydantic](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/streamlit-pydantic) package.

My job involves a lot of apps for business users to input some bits of data or upload files to be processed by one automation or another. I figured there must be a way to bootstrap these types of apps in Python based on the shape of the input data.

&#x200B;

[Demo Screencast](https://i.redd.it/1zwh8jps4xi81.gif)

## Full Walkthrough

## Skeleton

*GOAL:* Initialize git repo with necessary file scaffold:

* `app.py`: The main streamlit entry app
* `requirements.txt`: Pin versions of Python packages so deployment and development is repeatable
* `README.md`: This documentation
* `.gitignore`: Prevent secrets or large files or unecessary things from going into github
   * Recommended github python [gitignore template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Python.gitignore) works fine for this, slightly overkill
* `LICENSE`: [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) same as [Streamlit Terms](https://streamlit.io/terms-of-use)

&#x200B;

    mkdir python-form-generator
    cd python-form-generator/
    touch README.md LICENSE .gitignore app.py requirements.txt
    git init
    git checkout -b main
    git remote add origin git@github.com:gerardrbentley/python-form-generator.git
    git add .
    git commit -m ""skeleton""

## Install

We'll plan on 4 main packages for this:

* `streamlit`
* `pydantic`
* `streamlit-pydantic`
* `datamodel-code-generator`

&#x200B;

    python -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install streamlit-pydantic datamodel-code-generator
    pip list | grep ""streamlit\|pydantic\|datamodel-code""

*Note:* This lets `streamlit-pydantic` to choose which versions of `streamlit` and `pydantic` work for the latest release.

Saving the output to `requirements.txt` in the format:

    datamodel-code-generator==0.11.19
    pydantic==1.9.0
    streamlit==1.5.1
    streamlit-pydantic==0.5.0

Saving the output to requirements.txt allows new users / deploys to install pinned verions with something like the following:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

    git add requirements.txt README.md
    git commit -m ""install""

## Hello World

Adding the following to `app.py`:

    import streamlit as st
    
    
    def main() -> None:
        st.header(""Python Form Generator"")
        st.subheader(""Enter your JSON and get a free Pydantic model + Streamlit Input Form using it!"")
        json_input = st.text_area('JSON example', height=200)
        st.write(json_input)
    
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        main()

Then run with `streamlit` to check if basic input / processing frontend works.

    streamlit run app.py
    # ctrl + c to stop
    git add app.py README.md
    git commit -m ""input hello world""

## Model Generation

We'll draw from 3 sources for the meat and potatoes of this app:

* [Streamlit Pydantic Usage Guide](https://github.com/LukasMasuch/streamlit-pydantic#usage)
* [Datamodel Code Generator conversion](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator/blob/381abc1946c088c99dc79bebc62b7e37a2d4b8d3/datamodel_code_generator/__init__.py#L311)
* [JSON to Pydantic conversion](https://github.com/brokenloop/jsontopydantic/blob/master/server/app/scripts/generator.py)

## Imports

Expand import section of `app.py` to accomodate Streamlit Pydantic, Datamodel code generator, and GenSON

(Datamodel code generator is intended as CLI tool, so we have to dig a bit into it)

    import json
    
    from pydantic import Json, BaseModel
    from datamodel_code_generator.parser.jsonschema import JsonSchemaParser
    from genson import SchemaBuilder
    import streamlit as st
    import streamlit_pydantic as sp

## Upgraded Input

We'll use Streamlit Pydantic to get out of the box validation of the JSON that the user provides. Plus we get extensibility via the FormModel if we want to add more configuration options!

Instead of a plain `text_input` from streamlit, we utilize `sp.pydantic_form` and provide our model (which only has 1 input field for now!)

After getting some input JSON from the User it will pass off to converting to a model.

    class FormGeneratorModel(BaseModel):
        model_schema: Json
    
    
    def main() -> None:
        st.header(""Python Form Generator"")
        st.subheader(
            ""Enter your JSON and get a free Pydantic model + Streamlit Input Form using it!""
        )
        data = sp.pydantic_form(key=""json_input"", model=FormGeneratorModel)
        if data:
            show_generated_code(data.model_schema)

## Conversion

Following in the footsteps of JSON to Pydantic and Datamodel Code Generator, we use GenSON to build a JSONSchema representation from raw JSON data, then dump that into the Datamodel Code Generator parser.

We'll handle the same error case Datamodel code generator does, otherwise assume the happy path and display the results!

    def show_generated_code(schema: Json) -> None:
        model_code = json_to_pydantic(schema)
    
        if not model_code:
            st.error(""Models not found in the input data"")
        else:
            st.code(model_code)
    
    
    def json_to_pydantic(input_text: str) -> str:
        builder = SchemaBuilder()
        builder.add_object(input_text)
        schema = builder.to_schema()
        parser = JsonSchemaParser(
            source=json.dumps(schema),
            base_class=""pydantic.BaseModel"",
        )
    
        return parser.parse()

## LGTM

Trying out a simple entry (even simpler than the [littlest fullstack app](https://streamlit-postgres.gerardbentley.com/)) such as the following:

    {""body"": "":tada:"", ""username"": "":cat:""}

Produces expected result

    from __future__ import annotations
    
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    
    class Model(BaseModel):
        body: str
        username: str

Time to ship it and generate a Form!

    git add app.py README.md
    git commit -m ""model generation""

## Bootstrapping

Alright, we've got a nice Pydantic model, time to generate a Streamlit Pydantic scaffold from it and provide a download link.

## Update Show Model

We'll allow the user to download just the model into a `.py` file and hide the generated model unless they want to see it.

    def show_generated_code(schema: Json) -> None:
        model_code = json_to_pydantic(schema)
    
        if not model_code:
            st.error(""Models not found in the input data"")
        else:
            with st.expander(""Original Converted Model""):
                st.code(model_code, language=""python"")
            st.download_button(""Download Generated Model Only"", data=model_code, file_name=""model.py"", mime=""text/plain"")
            show_generated_form(model_code)

## Inject Generated Code

We only need 2 features to really bootstrap these forms:

* Added imports
* Retrieve form data in Streamlit app

I'll add a `main()` method to keep scope contained, but the Streamlit execution model embraces all [Python scripting](https://streamlit.io/)

    MAIN_TEMPLATE = """"""\
    
    
    def main() -> None:
        st.header(""Model Form Submission"")
        data = sp.pydantic_form(key=""my_model"", model=Model)
        if data:
            st.json(data.json())
    
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        main()
    """"""
    
    def show_generated_form(model_code: str) -> None:
        code_lines = model_code.split('\n')
        code_lines.insert(2, ""import streamlit_pydantic as sp"")
        code_lines.insert(2, ""import streamlit as st"")
    
        code_lines.insert(-1, MAIN_TEMPLATE)
    
        full_code = '\n'.join(code_lines)
    
        st.subheader(""Generated Streamlit Pydantic App"")
        st.caption(""Download it and run with `streamlit run model_form.py`"")
        st.download_button(""Download Generated Form!"", data=full_code, file_name=""model_form.py"", mime=""text/plain"")
        st.code(full_code, language=""python"")

## LGTM

Testing out the download and run on our simple model yields great results!

    git add app.py README.md
    git commit -m ""app generation""

## Wrap Up

That's it for the basic idea!

Next steps would be allowing configuration options such as ""all Optional"" and snake casing akin to JSON to Pydantic. Also more input forms, as Datamodel code generator handles OpenAPI, CSV data, and more.
